 <h2 class="aboutme">
    Hi, my name is Elinor Malayev, I am a tenth-grade student at Stella K Abraham High School for girls. In Stella K Abraham I was able to apply to a <a href="https://getmagic.org/">Magic Program</a>. The Magic Program pairs you with a mentor to help you study your STEM interests better. Given this opportunity, I was able to build this website with the help of my great mentor Leah Einhorn. Leah is a software engineer and has helped me successfully build this website. On this website, we discuss the causes, symptoms, and treatments of numerous Brain Disorders. Building this website has taught me so much. For starters, I learned how to gather research, code the research into a website, style the website to make it look presentable, and lastly how to publish my website for all to enjoy. Thank you for visiting my website.
