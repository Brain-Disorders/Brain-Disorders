        <h3>What Causes Parkinson's disease?</h3>
        <p>Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for allowing you to feel pleasure, satisfaction and motivation. </p>

            <li Class="list">Self care: physical exercise</li>
            <li Class="list">Medication can help control the symptoms of Parkinsonâ€™s. Most people with Parkinson's disease eventually need a medication called levodopa. Levodopa is absorbed by the nerve cells in your brain and turned into the chemical dopamine, which is used to transmit messages between the parts of the brain and nerves that control movement.</li>
