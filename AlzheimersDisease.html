        <h3>What Causes Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
        <p>The causes probably include a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The importance of any one of these factors in increasing or decreasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease may differ from person to person.</p>

        <h3>What happens to the brain if a patient has Alzheimer disease?</h3>
        <p>In Alzheimer's disease, as neurons are injured and die throughout the brain, connections between networks of neurons may break down, and many brain regions begin to shrink. By the final stages of Alzheimer's, this process—called brain atrophy—is widespread, causing significant loss of brain volume.</p>

    <div class="border">
        <h3>Treatment/Cure</h3>
        <p>There is unfortunately no cure for Alzheimer’s. However, medication can help to temporarily improve confusion. Galantamine, rivastigmine, and donepezil are cholinesterase inhibitors that are prescribed for mild to moderate Alzheimer's symptoms. These drugs may help reduce or control some cognitive and behavioral symptoms.
